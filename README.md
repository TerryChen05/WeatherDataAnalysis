Project was created March 2024 Using C:

The C code processes temperature data from various weather monitoring systems around the world between 1750 and 2015, and uses it to perform calculations to generate specific information:

1.) Calculates the yearly average land temperatures for each year between 1760 and 2015

2.) Calculates the average land temperature for each century (18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st)

3.) Calculates the monthly average land temperature of each month based on data from the year 1900 to 2015

4.) Determines the hottest and coldest month recorded based on land average temperatures

5.) Using the results from '1.)', determines the hottest and coldest year

6.) Using the results from '1.)', generates a data file to be graphed in GNUPlot (line plot of the yearly temperatures from 1760 to 2015)

7.) Generates a data file of the average land temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries and uses it to create a GNUPlot for a trend analysis

8.) Using the average, min, and max land temperatures, generates a data file to be graphed in GNUPlot to show the year by year trends of each dataset

9.) Calculates the average, min, and max temperature of the 19th, 20th, and 21st century, then uses GNUPlot to graph the data on 3 histograms plots

10.) Generates a data file of the land average temperatures with uncertainty from the years 2000 to 2015, then uses GNUPlot to graph an error plot

11.) Generates a data file of the land and ocean average temperatures 1850 to 2015, then uses GNUPlot to graph the two trends
